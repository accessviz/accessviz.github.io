                <h2>What I wished I knew then</h2>
                <p>As an outsider researcher, it can be daunting to begin working with disability communities. 
                    Over the last 15 years, I have been working with people who are blind or have low vision. 
                    I made several mistakes when I first began researching in this area, and the way 
                    I work with this community has evolved into partnerships that I hope benefit everyone involved. 
                    I'll share my mistakes and tips for building ongoing partnerships.</p>
                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Kim Marriott obtained his PhD in 1989 and worked at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center 
                    before joining Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, in 1993. 
                    He now leads the Monash Assistive Tech and Society (MATS) Centre, 
                    an interdisciplinary collective focusing on the relationships between 
                    people with disabilities and technology. 
                    His particular research focus is on the use of new technologies, 
                    such as AI, mixed reality, refreshable tactile displays, and 3D printing, 
                    to present data visualizations and other graphical information to 
                    people who are blind or have low vision. 
                    He recently wrote a book on the history of data visualization, 
                    including tactile graphics: The Golden Age of Data Visualization: How Did We Get Here?</p>
